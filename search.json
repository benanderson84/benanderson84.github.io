    "text": "As the landscape of college basketball has changed because of the transfer portal and NIL, an aspect that fans have lost in the NCAA Tournament is the Cinderella teams that really bring the tournament alive.\nOne of the more notable Cinderella teams that come to mind is the 2011 VCU Rams coached by Shaka Smart. Smart’s team surpassed all expectations and made it to the Final Four before the season was ended by Gordon Hayward and the Butler Bulldogs.\nAfter just one Sweet Sixteen appearance following that run including seven losses in the Round of 64 and two other career stops at Texas and now Marquette, Shaka has continued to be unsuccessful at the most prestigious tournament in college basketball. After another first-round exit in the postseason, it begs the question: How does Shaka Smart keep getting coaching jobs?\nLet’s find out.\nSports Reference provides box scores of every college basketball game from 2010-2025 representing when Smart was hired by VCU in 2010 after the departure of Anthony Grant.\nLet’s take a look at the number of wins at the three different schools where Smart has coached and compare them to how each program performed during his different tenures.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nboxscores &lt;- read_csv(\"boxscores20102025.csv\")\n\ntotalpoints &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  group_by(season, team_display_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_games = n(),\n    total_points_scored = sum(team_score),\n    total_points_allowed = sum(opponent_team_score)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(total_points_scored &gt; 300) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    season_ppg = total_points_scored / total_games,\n    season_dppg = total_points_allowed / total_games\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(team_season = paste(team_display_name, season))\n\nwinning &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  mutate(Win = case_when(team_score &gt; opponent_team_score ~ 1, team_score &lt; opponent_team_score ~ 0)) |&gt; \n  group_by(team_display_name, season) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    games = n(),\n    wins = sum(Win)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(team_season = paste(team_display_name, season))\n\nshakateamwinning &lt;- winning |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name == \"VCU Rams\" | team_display_name == \"Texas Longhorns\" | team_display_name == \"Marquette Golden Eagles\" )\n\nshakavcu &lt;- shakateamwinning |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"VCU Rams\") |&gt; filter(season &gt;= 2010 & season &lt;= 2015)\nshakatex &lt;- shakateamwinning |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Texas Longhorns\") |&gt; filter(season &gt;= 2016 & season &lt;= 2021) \nshakamar &lt;- shakateamwinning |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Marquette Golden Eagles\") |&gt; filter(season &gt;= 2022 & season &lt;= 2025)\n\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=shakateamwinning, aes(x=season, y=wins, group = team_display_name), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=shakavcu, aes(x=season, y=wins, group = team_display_name), color=\"#FFB300\", linewidth=2) +  \n  geom_line(data=shakatex, aes(x=season, y=wins, group = team_display_name), color=\"#bf5700\", linewidth=2) +  \n  geom_line(data=shakamar, aes(x=season, y=wins, group = team_display_name), color=\"#003366\", linewidth=2) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Number of Wins\", \n    title=\"Shaka's Slippery Slope\", \n    subtitle=\"How did Shaka Smart impact these programs during his tenure?\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Ben Anderson\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three programs showed a decrease during Smart’s tenure with the school, including a Texas program that managed only 11 wins in the 2017 season. When he settled in a power conference such as the Big 12, Smart’s number of wins in a season settled down to around 20 wins. After he departed for Marquette, the number of wins for Texas shot back up to that 25-win mark where they are joined by another one of Smart’s former employers, VCU.\nWith multiple seasons of 25+ wins, it is difficult to appreciate only one Sweet Sixteen appearance that featured his team that was given a number two seed in the tournament. Let’s put his Final Four season into perspective against previous NCAA Champions over the years.\n\n\nCode\nfinalfour &lt;- totalpoints |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name == \"VCU Rams\") |&gt; \n  filter(season == 2011)\n\n\nshaka &lt;- totalpoints |&gt; \n  filter(team_season == \"VCU Rams 2011\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2024\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2025\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2023\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2010\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2012\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2013\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2014\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2015\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2016\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2017\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2018\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2019\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2020\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2021\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2022\") \n\n\n\nlastchamps &lt;- totalpoints |&gt; \n  filter(team_season== \"Florida Gators 2025\" | team_season== \"UConn Huskies 2024\" | team_season == \"UConn Huskies 2023\" | team_season == \"Kansas Jayhawks 2022\" | team_season == \"Baylor Bears 2021\" | team_season == \"Virginia Cavaliers 2019\" | team_season == \"Villanova Wildcats 2018\" | team_season == \"Villanova Wildcats 2016\" | team_season == \"North Carolina Tar Heels 2017\" | team_season == \"Duke Blue Devils 2015\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_text(data=finalfour, aes(x=season_ppg, y=season_dppg +1, label=team_season), size=4) +\n  geom_point(data=shaka, aes(x=season_ppg, y=season_dppg), size=3) +\n  geom_point(data=lastchamps, aes(x=season_ppg, y=season_dppg,), color=\"blue\", size=4) +\n  geom_point(data=finalfour, aes(x=season_ppg, y=season_dppg), color=\"red\", size=6) +\n  scale_x_continuous() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Points Per Game\", \n    y=\"Defensive Points Allowed\", \n    title=\"Shaka's Final Four run was nothing short of lucky \", \n    subtitle=\"His teams (in black) compared to recent NCAA champions (in blue)\", \n    caption=\"Source: Sports Reference | By Ben Anderson\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted, a team like VCU will most likely not match up with other blue bloods like Duke and Kentucky. But how about Shaka’s team that knocked off No. 1 seeded Kansas? They sit towards the bottom compared to every team he has coached in his career.\nThe 2011 run looks like it truly was one of the great Cinderella stories in recent years. Let’s take a closer look at how his team has performed offensively in the Big Dance in comparison to the historic run with VCU.\n\n\nCode\npostseason &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  filter(season_type == \"3\")\n\n\npostseasonfg &lt;- postseason |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    team_season = paste(team_display_name, season)\n  )\n\nshakapostseason &lt;- postseasonfg |&gt; \n  filter(team_season == \"VCU Rams 2011\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2024\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2025\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2023\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2012\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2013\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2014\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2015\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2016\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2018\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2021\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2022\")\n\nsmartpostseasonpct&lt;- shakapostseason |&gt; \n  group_by(team_season) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    average_fg_pct = mean(field_goal_pct/100)\n  )\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nsmartpostseasonpct |&gt; \n  select(team_season, average_fg_pct) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(average_fg_pct)) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    team_season = \"Smart's Postseason Teams\",\n    average_fg_pct = \"Team Average FG Percentage\" \n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Was 2011 Shaka's One Shining Moment?\",\n    subtitle = \"How has his different teams performed offensively on the biggest stage?\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\", size=14),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Ben Anderson  |  **Source:** Basketball Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(average_fg_pct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = team_season == \"VCU Rams 2011\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas 2011 Shaka's One Shining Moment?\n\n\nHow has his different teams performed offensively on the biggest stage?\n\n\nSmart's Postseason Teams\nTeam Average FG Percentage\n\n\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles 2024\n47.6%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2013\n46.8%\n\n\nTexas Longhorns 2018\n46.3%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2014\n46.2%\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles 2023\n45.1%\n\n\nTexas Longhorns 2021\n45.0%\n\n\nTexas Longhorns 2016\n44.6%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2011\n42.7%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2012\n41.4%\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles 2025\n40.7%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2015\n38.1%\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles 2022\n35.6%\n\n\n\nBy: Ben Anderson | Source: Basketball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart has continued to fail when it matters most, losing to a lower seed in eight of his last nine NCAA tournament appearances. That is not easy on anybody.\nCollege athletics has a current focus on constant movement and that fits in perfectly with the rollercoaster coaching career Shaka Smart has had in his sixteen-year career. Players and coaches are moving around and opportunities are opening up for people everywhere.\nIs Shaka Smart riding the high of the 2011 VCU season as he moves around to these different opportunities? It certainly is not because of his performance in the postseason."

After another first-round exit in the postseason, it begs the question: How does Shaka Smart keep getting coaching jobs?\nLet’s find out.\nSports Reference provides box scores of every college basketball game from 2010-2025 representing when Smart was hired by VCU in 2010 after the departure of Anthony Grant.\nLet’s take a look at the number of wins at the three different schools where Smart has coached and compare them to how each program performed during his different tenures.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nboxscores &lt;- read_csv(\"boxscores20102025.csv\")\n\ntotalpoints &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  group_by(season, team_display_name) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    total_games = n(),\n    total_points_scored = sum(team_score),\n    total_points_allowed = sum(opponent_team_score)\n  ) |&gt; \n  filter(total_points_scored &gt; 300) |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    season_ppg = total_points_scored / total_games,\n    season_dppg = total_points_allowed / total_games\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(team_season = paste(team_display_name, season))\n\nwinning &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  mutate(Win = case_when(team_score &gt; opponent_team_score ~ 1, team_score &lt; opponent_team_score ~ 0)) |&gt; \n  group_by(team_display_name, season) |&gt; \n  summarize(\n    games = n(),\n    wins = sum(Win)\n  ) |&gt; \n  mutate(team_season = paste(team_display_name, season))\n\nshakateamwinning &lt;- winning |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name == \"VCU Rams\" | team_display_name == \"Texas Longhorns\" | team_display_name == \"Marquette Golden Eagles\" )\n\nshakavcu &lt;- shakateamwinning |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"VCU Rams\") |&gt; filter(season &gt;= 2010 & season &lt;= 2015)\nshakatex &lt;- shakateamwinning |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Texas Longhorns\") |&gt; filter(season &gt;= 2016 & season &lt;= 2021) \nshakamar &lt;- shakateamwinning |&gt; filter(team_display_name == \"Marquette Golden Eagles\") |&gt; filter(season &gt;= 2022 & season &lt;= 2025)\n\n  ggplot() + \n  geom_line(data=shakateamwinning, aes(x=season, y=wins, group = team_display_name), color=\"grey\") +\n  geom_line(data=shakavcu, aes(x=season, y=wins, group = team_display_name), color=\"#FFB300\", linewidth=2) +  \n  geom_line(data=shakatex, aes(x=season, y=wins, group = team_display_name), color=\"#bf5700\", linewidth=2) +  \n  geom_line(data=shakamar, aes(x=season, y=wins, group = team_display_name), color=\"#003366\", linewidth=2) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Season\", \n    y=\"Number of Wins\", \n    title=\"Shaka's Slippery Slope\", \n    subtitle=\"How did Shaka Smart impact these programs during his tenure?\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Ben Anderson\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 20, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\",\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAll three programs showed a decrease during Smart’s tenure with the school, including a Texas program that managed only 11 wins in the 2017 season. When he settled in a power conference such as the Big 12, Smart’s number of wins in a season settled down to around 20 wins. After he departed for Marquette, the number of wins for Texas shot back up to that 25-win mark where they are joined by another one of Smart’s former employers, VCU.\nWith multiple seasons of 25+ wins, it is difficult to appreciate only one Sweet Sixteen appearance that featured his team that was given a number two seed in the tournament. Let’s put his Final Four season into perspective against previous NCAA Champions over the years.\n\n\nCode\nfinalfour &lt;- totalpoints |&gt; \n  filter(team_display_name == \"VCU Rams\") |&gt; \n  filter(season == 2011)\n\n\nshaka &lt;- totalpoints |&gt; \n  filter(team_season == \"VCU Rams 2011\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2024\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2025\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2023\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2010\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2012\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2013\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2014\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2015\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2016\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2017\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2018\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2019\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2020\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2021\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2022\") \n\n\n\nlastchamps &lt;- totalpoints |&gt; \n  filter(team_season== \"Florida Gators 2025\" | team_season== \"UConn Huskies 2024\" | team_season == \"UConn Huskies 2023\" | team_season == \"Kansas Jayhawks 2022\" | team_season == \"Baylor Bears 2021\" | team_season == \"Virginia Cavaliers 2019\" | team_season == \"Villanova Wildcats 2018\" | team_season == \"Villanova Wildcats 2016\" | team_season == \"North Carolina Tar Heels 2017\" | team_season == \"Duke Blue Devils 2015\")\n\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_text(data=finalfour, aes(x=season_ppg, y=season_dppg +1, label=team_season), size=4) +\n  geom_point(data=shaka, aes(x=season_ppg, y=season_dppg), size=3) +\n  geom_point(data=lastchamps, aes(x=season_ppg, y=season_dppg,), color=\"blue\", size=4) +\n  geom_point(data=finalfour, aes(x=season_ppg, y=season_dppg), color=\"red\", size=6) +\n  scale_x_continuous() +\n   labs(\n    x=\"Offensive Points Per Game\", \n    y=\"Defensive Points Allowed\", \n    title=\"Shaka's Final Four run was nothing short of lucky \", \n    subtitle=\"His teams (in black) compared to recent NCAA champions (in blue)\", \n    caption=\"Source: Basketball Reference | By Ben Anderson\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 17, face = \"bold\"),\n    axis.title = element_text(size = 10), \n    plot.subtitle = element_text(size=13), \n    panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n    ) \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGranted, a team like VCU will most likely not match up with other blue bloods like Duke and Kentucky. But how about Shaka’s team that knocked off No. 1 seeded Kansas? They sit towards the bottom compared to every team he has coached in his career.\nThe 2011 run looks like it truly was one of the great Cinderella stories in recent years. Let’s take a closer look at how his team has performed offensively in the Big Dance in comparison to the historic run with VCU.\n\n\nCode\npostseason &lt;- boxscores |&gt; \n  filter(season_type == \"3\")\n\n\npostseasonfg &lt;- postseason |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    team_season = paste(team_display_name, season)\n  )\n\nshakapostseason &lt;- postseasonfg |&gt; \n  filter(team_season == \"VCU Rams 2011\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2024\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2025\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2023\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2012\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2013\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2014\" | team_season== \"VCU Rams 2015\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2016\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2018\" | team_season== \"Texas Longhorns 2021\" | team_season == \"Marquette Golden Eagles 2022\")\n\nsmartpostseasonpct&lt;- shakapostseason |&gt; \n  group_by(team_season) |&gt; \n  summarise(\n    average_fg_pct = mean(field_goal_pct/100)\n  )\n\nlibrary(gt)\n\n\nsmartpostseasonpct |&gt; \n  select(team_season, average_fg_pct) |&gt; \n  arrange(desc(average_fg_pct)) |&gt; \n  gt() |&gt; \n  cols_label(\n    team_season = \"Smart's Postseason Teams\",\n    average_fg_pct = \"True Shooting Percentage\" \n  ) |&gt; \n  tab_header(\n    title = \"Was 2011 Shaka's One Shining Moment?\",\n    subtitle = \"How has his different teams performed offensively on the biggest stage?\"\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\", align = \"left\"),\n    locations = cells_title(\"title\")\n  ) |&gt; tab_style(\n    style = cell_text(color = \"black\", align = \"left\", size=14),\n    locations = cells_title(\"subtitle\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_source_note(\n    source_note = md(\"**By:** Ben Anderson  |  **Source:** Basketball Reference\")\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n     locations = cells_column_labels(columns = everything()),\n     style = list(\n       cell_borders(sides = \"bottom\", weight = px(3)),\n       cell_text(weight = \"bold\", size=12)\n     )\n   ) |&gt;\n  opt_row_striping() |&gt; \n  opt_table_lines(\"none\") |&gt;\n    fmt_percent(\n    columns = c(average_fg_pct),\n    decimals = 1\n  ) |&gt;\n  tab_style(\n    style = list(\n      cell_fill(color = \"gold\"),\n      cell_text(color = \"black\", weight = \"bold\")\n      ),\n    locations = cells_body(\n      rows = team_season == \"VCU Rams 2011\")\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWas 2011 Shaka's One Shining Moment?\n\n\nHow has his different teams performed offensively on the biggest stage?\n\n\nSmart's Postseason Teams\nTrue Shooting Percentage\n\n\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles 2024\n47.6%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2013\n46.8%\n\n\nTexas Longhorns 2018\n46.3%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2014\n46.2%\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles 2023\n45.1%\n\n\nTexas Longhorns 2021\n45.0%\n\n\nTexas Longhorns 2016\n44.6%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2011\n42.7%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2012\n41.4%\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles 2025\n40.7%\n\n\nVCU Rams 2015\n38.1%\n\n\nMarquette Golden Eagles 2022\n35.6%\n\n\n\nBy: Ben Anderson | Source: Basketball Reference\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmart has continued to fail when it matters most, losing to a lower seed in eight of his last nine NCAA tournament appearances. That is not easy on anybody.\nCollege athletics has a current focus on constant movement and that fits in perfectly with the rollercoaster coaching career Shaka Smart has had in his sixteen-year career. Players and coaches are moving around and opportunities are opening up for people everywhere.\nIs Shaka Smart riding the high of the 2011 VCU season as he moves around to these different opportunities? It certainly is not because of his performance in the postseason."
